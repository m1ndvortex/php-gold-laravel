1. Project Overview & Core Architecture
Vision:
Build a secure, scalable, and RTL-compliant SaaS platform for Persian-speaking jewelers (طلافروش‌ها), optimized for real-world jewelry workflows such as invoicing, inventory, accounting, and CRM — all within a multi-tenant environment that guarantees data isolation, customizability, and performance.

Key Goals:

100% Persian (Farsi) UI with perfect RTL layout; English UI optional toggle in settings.

Isolated tenant environments for data privacy and security.

Modular architecture with pluggable, reusable Laravel service providers.

Clean developer experience with fully Dockerized Laravel + Vue/React + MySQL + Redis stack.

User Roles:

Super Admin: Platform-wide operations, tenant management, billing. No access to tenant business data.

Tenant Admin (Jeweler): Manages own workspace, team, settings, and reports.

Tenant Employees: Role-based permissions (Cashier, Accountant, etc.), supporting custom roles defined by Tenant Admin.

New Feature: Session Device Tracker — View active sessions and force logout devices remotely.

2. Technology Stack & Infrastructure
Backend: PHP Laravel 10+ with built-in support for multi-tenancy (e.g., tenancy for Laravel or spatie/laravel-multitenancy).

Frontend: Vue.js or React.js + Vite + Tailwind CSS (TypeScript) — Fully RTL-compliant with language toggle (Farsi primary).

Database: MySQL with Eloquent ORM supporting multi-tenant schema separation or database per tenant.

Caching & Queues: Redis for sessions, rate-limiting, real-time cache, and job queues.

CI/CD: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI with Dockerized Laravel, DB, Redis, and Nginx services.

Dependencies: Self-hosted fonts and libraries only, no external CDNs, for privacy and performance.

Docker Setup:

Laravel backend with hot reload

Frontend Vite server with volume mount

MySQL with volume persistence

Redis container for caching and async processing
