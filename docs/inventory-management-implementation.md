# Inventory Management System Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of the inventory management functionality for the jewelry SaaS platform, including product categorization, barcode/QR code management, stock tracking, and Bill of Materials (BOM) system.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### 1. Product Categorization System
- **Hierarchical Categories**: Support for parent-child category relationships
- **Jewelry-Specific Types**: Raw Gold (18K, 21K, 24K), Finished Jewelry (Rings, Necklaces, Earrings, Bracelets), Coins, Stones, and Other items
- **Localization**: Persian and English names for all categories
- **Category Settings**: Configurable settings per category type (purity tracking, sizing, certification requirements)

### 2. Barcode/QR Code Generation and Scanning
- **Multiple Barcode Formats**: Support for CODE128, EAN13, EAN8, CODE39
- **QR Code Generation**: Product metadata including specifications and stock levels
- **Code Scanning**: Identify products by barcode, SKU, or QR code data
- **Batch Processing**: Generate barcodes for multiple products
- **Printable Labels**: Customizable label generation with product information

### 3. Stock Movement Tracking
- **Automatic Logging**: All inventory changes are automatically tracked
- **Movement Types**: Add, Subtract, Adjustment, Transfer, Production, Sale, Purchase, Return
- **Manual Adjustments**: Stock corrections with reason tracking and audit trails
- **Stock Validation**: Prevent negative inventory with configurable overrides
- **Batch Tracking**: Support for batch numbers in stock movements

### 4. Bill of Materials (BOM) System
- **Multi-Component Products**: Support for products made from multiple components
- **Wastage Calculation**: Configurable wastage percentages for manufacturing
- **Stock Availability Checking**: Verify component availability before production
- **Automated Production**: Consume components and produce finished goods
- **BOM Explosion**: Multi-level component breakdown reports
- **Circular Dependency Prevention**: Prevent invalid BOM structures

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
- **products**: Main product table with categorization and stock tracking
